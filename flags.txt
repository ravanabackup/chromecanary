Chrome heap profiler start mode.
Starts heap profiling service that records sampled memory allocation profile having each sample attributed with a callstack. The sampling resolution is controlled with --memlog-sampling-rate flag. Recorded heap dumps can be obtained at chrome://tracing [category:memory-infra] and chrome://memory-internals. This setting controls which processes will be profiled since their start. To profile any given process at a later time use chrome://memory-internals page. – Mac, Windows, Linux, ChromeOS, Android

#memlog

Disabled
Heap profiling sampling interval (in bytes).
Heap profiling service uses Poisson process to sample allocations. Default value for the interval between samples is 1000000 (1MB). This results in low noise for large and/or frequent allocations [size * frequency >> 1MB]. This means that aggregate numbers [e.g. total size of malloc-ed objects] and large and/or frequent allocations can be trusted with high fidelity. Lower intervals produce higher samples resolution, but come at a cost of higher performance overhead. – Mac, Windows, Linux, ChromeOS, Android

#memlog-sampling-rate

Default
Heap profiling stack traces type.
By default heap profiling service records native stacks. A post-processing step is required to symbolize the stacks.
