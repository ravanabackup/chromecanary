Chrome heap profiler start mode.
Starts heap profiling service that records sampled memory allocation profile having each sample attributed with a callstack. The sampling resolution is controlled with --memlog-sampling-rate flag.

To profile any given process at a later time use chrome://memory-internals page. – Mac, Windows, Linux, ChromeOS, Android

#memlog

Disabled
Heap profiling sampling interval (in bytes).
Heap profiling service uses Poisson process to sample allocations. Default value for the interval between samples is 1000000 (1MB).

This means that aggregate numbers [e.g. total size of malloc-ed objects] and large and/or frequent allocations can be trusted with high fidelity. Lower intervals produce higher samples resolution, but come at a cost of higher performance overhead. – Mac, Windows, Linux, ChromeOS, Android

#memlog-sampling-rate
